# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I prioritize modular design, clear naming conventions, and thorough documentation. During Project One, I developed a CRUD Python module that handled all interactions with the MongoDB database. This module served as a clean interface for performing create, read, update, and delete operations. By keeping database logic separate from the rest of the application (such as the dashboard code in Project Two), the codebase remained organized and easier to manage.
One major advantage of this approach was flexibility. When I began connecting the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, I didn’t need to rewrite any database logic—I could simply call the appropriate functions from the existing CRUD module. This saved time and reduced the risk of introducing bugs. Another benefit is future reusability. The CRUD module is not tightly coupled to any specific user interface or dataset, so it can be adapted for different projects or clients that use similar MongoDB structures. For example, I could reuse it in a web application with a different front end (like Flask or React), or expand it to include more advanced query capabilities and validation checks. This approach makes the codebase scalable and much easier to maintain over time.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable components and applying a structured problem-solving process that includes analysis, design, implementation, and testing. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I began by carefully reviewing the database and dashboard requirements to understand what the client needed—specifically, how they wanted to track and visualize data related to rescue dogs, such as breed, location, and training status. Compared to previous assignments, this project required a deeper level of integration between different components—particularly the database and user interface. In earlier courses, assignments were often more focused on isolated coding tasks or simpler data structures. With this project, I had to consider how the backend (MongoDB with the CRUD module) would communicate with the front end (interactive widgets in Jupyter Notebook), and how data would be filtered, displayed, and updated in real time. To meet future client requests, I would continue using the strategy of starting with a clear data model—possibly using tools like ER diagrams or JSON schema definitions, to visualize the structure of the database. I would also apply agile development techniques, such as creating user stories and iterating based on feedback. Using flexible technologies like MongoDB and designing reusable modules (like the CRUD interface) helps create systems that are easier to scale and adapt as client needs evolve.

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve real-world problems through the design and implementation of efficient, scalable, and reliable systems. Our work matters because it underpins almost every aspect of modern business, from data analysis and automation to user interaction and system security. In the case of Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard and CRUD module enable the organization to manage and visualize critical data about rescue operations more effectively. This improves their decision-making, saves time, and ultimately supports their mission of saving lives. By applying computer science principles, I contributed to building a tool that not only meets technical requirements but also has a meaningful real-world impact.
